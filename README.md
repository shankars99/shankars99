- Hi, I’m Shankar
- I'm passionate about Cryptography, Blockchain, and Distributed Systems
- I'm also an advocate for Chainlink
- I’m the architect and creator of 'StorkNet', a datalayer that supports querying to on-chains contracts intended to decouple the data layer from the EVM-Chain architecture to allow cross-chain-data-transfers, reduction of gas fees, and create a queryable data model for EVM Contracts by turning the state-machine aka Ethereum into a stateless one
- Currently working on a stackmachine like ETH but RISC styled (to be public soon)
