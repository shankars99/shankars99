- Hi, I’m Shankar
- I'm into Cryptography and Blockchains
- I work at LayerZero Labs and am a Lead Lab Maintainer at Hyperledger Labs (Linux Foundation Decentralized Trust)
- I helped co-found the UMass Blockchain Club
- StackAttack is a stackmachine like ETH but RISC=V styled
- Part of Encode's ZKSync Zero Knowledge Study Cohort 2023 and Ethereum Protocol Studies 2024
- I created 'StorkNet' in 2021, a datalayer that supports querying to on-chains contracts intended to decouple the data layer from the EVM-Chain architecture to allow cross-chain-data-transfers, reduction of gas fees, and create a queryable data model for EVM Contracts by turning the state-machine aka Ethereum into a stateless one. Uses light clients running on networks and storage proofs.
