- Hi, I’m Shankar
- I'm into Cryptography and Blockchains
- I work at LayerZero Labs and am a Lead Lab Maintainer at Hyperledger Labs (Linux Foundation Decentralized Trust)
- I'm an advocate for Chainlink and office bearer at UMass Blockchain Club
- I’m the architect and creator of 'StorkNet', a datalayer that supports querying to on-chains contracts intended to decouple the data layer from the EVM-Chain architecture to allow cross-chain-data-transfers, reduction of gas fees, and create a queryable data model for EVM Contracts by turning the state-machine aka Ethereum into a stateless one. Uses light clients running on networks and storage proofs. 
- StackAttack is a stackmachine like ETH but RISC styled
- Part of Encode's ZKSync Zero Knowledge Study Cohort 2023 and Ethereum Protocol Studies 2024
